# titanic_analysis
Transatlantic Survival pipeline using Supervised Machine Learning

### Summary
A data pipeline to perform exploratory data analysis, feature selection, preprocessing and pipeline building to review the performance of different machine learning algorithms on the titanic dataset. The best performing model was a KNN Classifier; however Multinomial Naive Bayes was the chosen model as given the extrinsic metrics performed much better.
